# Project Roadmap

This document outlines where the project is headed and which tasks are suitable for new contributors.

## Long-Term Objectives

- Build a collection of roughly twenty JavaScript visualizations that share a common "node" concept.
  - Each visualization should be stylistically distinctive.
  - Nodes should be able to transform or animate into multiple nodes in interesting ways.
- Provide a standard API for interacting with nodes so visualizations can easily integrate with data sources.
- Develop a simple, standardized UI for adjusting visualization parameters, importing and exporting presets, and saving settings in `localStorage`.

## New Contributor Tasks

These items are suitable for newcomers looking for somewhere to start:

- Add or refine individual visualizations that demonstrate the node concept and show a unique visual style.
- Expand styling options or animations of existing visualizers.
- Keep the `README.md` and other documentation accurate whenever changes are made.

Agents should avoid implementing items listed under **Long-Term Objectives** unless explicitly instructed to do so.
