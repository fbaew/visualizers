# Visualizers

Various self-contained visualizations built with HTML and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` is a simple launcher that links to each visualizer.
- Every visualizer lives in its own folder containing an `index.html` file.

### Available Visualizers

- **Layered Visualizer** â€“ found in `layered/`.

## Layered Visualizer

Open `layered/index.html` in a browser to see a customizable multi-layer
visualization. Press **Toggle Settings** in the top-right corner to reveal
controls for each layer. Three layers are created by default and you can adjust
shape, offsets, scaling, colour, blur amount and animation speed in real time.
You can also add or remove layers on the fly, choose from several presets or
randomize all layer settings with a single click.
