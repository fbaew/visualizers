Visualizations! All self-contained, HTML+Javascript. For fun.

## Layered Visualizer

Open `index.html` in a browser to see a customizable multi-layer visualization.
Press **Toggle Settings** in the top-right corner to reveal controls for each
layer. Three layers are created by default and you can adjust their shape,
offsets, scaling, colour, blur amount and animation speed in real time.
